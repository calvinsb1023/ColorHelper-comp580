        \n\nTo take a picture in a certain half of the screen, simply tap the \"Take … Picture\" button for the corresponding half.
        \n\nTo identify a color in a picture, tap the color once.
        \n\nTo clear the color tags in one half of the screen, tap the \"Clear\" button in that half.
        \n\nTo remove the image entirely, tap the \"Retake … Picture\" button for the half you want to wipe.
        \n\nYou can toggle the flash by pressing the flash button on the bottom right, but turning the flash will have a significantly negative impact on color detection.
